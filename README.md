Version Control and Documentation: i used GitHub for version control and maintain a well-documented ReadMe.md file to explain project functionalities and user instructions.
Azure Deployment: I deployed the final application to Azure App Service for secure and accessible web hosting.

### Technology Options of Choice:

ASP.NET MVC: A mature and well-established framework for building web applications.
